## Projects List
Here is a list of the **10 projects** included in this repository:

### 1. **Basic OTA Updates**
This project demonstrates Over-the-Air (OTA) firmware updates for the ESP8266 using the Arduino IDE. It allows you to upload new code to the ESP8266 wirelessly without needing a physical connection. OTA updates are essential for remote device management and maintenance.

### 2. **Blinking LED with ESP8266**
A simple project to blink the built-in LED of the ESP8266 module. It serves as a beginner-friendly introduction to programming the ESP8266 and understanding its GPIO pins. The project highlights the active-low behavior of the ESP8266's onboard LED.

### 3. **LED Control via Telegram**
This project enables you to control an LED connected to the ESP8266 using a Telegram Bot. It uses the Universal Telegram Bot Library to send and receive commands via Telegram. This is a great example of integrating IoT devices with messaging platforms for remote control.

### 4. **LED Control via Web Server**
This project creates a web server on the ESP8266 to control an LED remotely through a web interface. Users can turn the LED on or off by accessing the ESP8266's IP address in a browser. It demonstrates how to build a simple web-based IoT control system.

### 5. **LED Control via Blynk App**
This project uses the Blynk mobile app to control an LED connected to the ESP8266. Blynk provides an intuitive interface for IoT device management. It showcases how to integrate ESP8266 with cloud-based platforms for real-time control and monitoring.

### 6. **Real-Time Clock (RTC) Display**
This project displays real-time clock data on a 4-digit 7-segment display using the ESP8266 and an RTC module. It fetches the current time and updates the display continuously. It’s a practical example of using RTC modules for time-sensitive IoT applications.

### 7. **Servo Motor Control via Web Server**
This project allows you to control a servo motor using a web server hosted on the ESP8266. Users can adjust the servo angle through a web interface. It demonstrates how to integrate hardware actuators with web-based control systems.

### 8. **SMTP Mail Transfer (Text)**
This project sends emails using the ESP8266 and an SMTP server. It uses the ESP-Mail-Client library to send text-based emails to a specified recipient. It’s a great example of integrating IoT devices with email services for notifications and alerts.

### 9. **TM1637 4-Digit Display**
This project displays numbers on a 4-digit 7-segment display using the ESP8266 and the TM1637 driver. It demonstrates how to interface the ESP8266 with external display modules. The project can be extended to show sensor data or other numerical information.

### 10. **WhatsApp Message Sender**
This project sends WhatsApp messages using the ESP8266 and the CallMeBot API. It allows you to send custom messages to a specified WhatsApp number. It’s a practical example of integrating IoT devices with messaging platforms for notifications and alerts.
